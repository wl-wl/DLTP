# DataSets
QSP400 datasets:quorum sensing peptides(QSPs)
dataPro plays the processed training set and test set;
dataPro_dependent plays the processed independent verification collection.
CPP740 datasets:cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) 
similar to above.

# QSP400
training file plays the 5-fold cross-validation;
comparing file plays the comparative experiment with three methods;
independent_ver file plays the independent verification;
feature_subset file plays the feature subset experiment;
shap file plays the feature interpretability analysis.
